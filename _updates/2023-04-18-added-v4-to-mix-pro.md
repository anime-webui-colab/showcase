I thought MIX-Pro models wouldn't get even more colors, I was wrong! I really like the vibrancy of the generations of this model!

As usual, any models in the MIX-Pro family is such a banger, I recommend pairing it with EasyNegative TI to fix some anomalies. :)

If you want to try this colorful model, the [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NUROISEA/anime-webui-colab/blob/main/notebooks/mix-pro-v3.ipynb) is always available ;)
