Two stylized models, one's that is sharp and clean and the other is illustration like with the thick lines and stuff! (I cannot write words, I have tiny brain)

Yeah anyways, the prompts of the images are intact, you can check the metadata of them.

As always, they have colabs made, you can check out [VOXO](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NUROISEA/anime-webui-colab/blob/main/notebooks/voxo.ipynb)'s and [Dark Sushi Mixes](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NUROISEA/anime-webui-colab/blob/main/notebooks/dark_sushi_mix.ipynb) if you want to try them :)

Alight, thanks for checking this patch notes up! Have a good day!
