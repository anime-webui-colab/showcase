*Images should have the metadata if you want to see the prompts :)*

A new version of MIX Pro just dropped and basing on my limited testing, it still retains the aesthetic of V3 but with slight improvement to the composition, I think lol. 

underline0000 retains the things I liked about soul0000; the model is worth checking out!

As always, the colab for [MIX-Pro](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NUROISEA/anime-webui-colab/blob/main/notebooks/mix-pro-v3.ipynb) and [soul0000](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NUROISEA/anime-webui-colab/blob/main/notebooks/soul0000.ipynb) are here if you want to try them out :)
