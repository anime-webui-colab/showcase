*Images should have the metadata if you want to see the prompt :)*

I noticeable improvement from 2.5 for Counterfeit, I can feel like the model is more stylized. Maybe I'm kinda biased? XDD

Eimis' has some polish but I kinda feel like the model is lightly weaker than v1. Alternative, hmmm...., I don't like in the set, I'm sorry D:.

As always the Colab for [Counterfeit](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NUROISEA/anime-webui-colab/blob/main/notebooks/counterfeit.ipynb) and [Eimis' Anime Models](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NUROISEA/anime-webui-colab/blob/main/notebooks/eimis_anime_diffusion.ipynb) are here

That's all, see ya! (If I feel like model hunting again ðŸ˜…)
