If I didn't saw this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/WaifuDiffusion/comments/12kud2t/model_testing_camelliamix_v2_bonus_nuts/), I would have never have thought to add this to my colabs. So, thank you megapod_200 lol

This model leans toward 2.5D for the most part but still retains that "illustration" feel that I like. 

I am writing this as I am falling asleep so I'll end it here haha

Go check out the [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NUROISEA/anime-webui-colab/blob/main/notebooks/camelliamix.ipynb) I made for this model :)
