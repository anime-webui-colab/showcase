  <summary>My thoughts about this model</summary>
  Successor of AnythingV3? Nah, this is based off AbyssOrangeMix2 and more models being mixed in. Although not the
  official continuation of AV3, the results are really nice. I prefer Anyv4 over V4.5 since it feels more consistent,
  but don't get me wrong, 4.5 is great! At the end of the day it comes down to your preference.
