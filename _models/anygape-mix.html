  <summary>My thoughts about this model</summary>
  This model has another variant, but that model is based off berry mix, it gives off realistic looking ones. Which I
  avoid. Talking about the remaining one, <code>AnyV3Ga+ElysiumV3</code>, I like how soft the generations feel, a little
  bit artsy compared to the base AnythingV3 model, thanks to Elysium being mixed in.
